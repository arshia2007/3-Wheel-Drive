Three-Wheeled Omni-Directional Robot
About
The three-wheeled omnidirectional robot in this project can move precisely and smoothly in any direction. The robot can move precisely forward, backward, laterally, and diagonally thanks to its inverse kinematics movement control system, which is controlled by a wired PS2 controller. Because of its stability and balance optimization, the design guarantees precise control on a variety of surfaces and when changing directions quickly. Speed settings that can be changed improve control and avoid overheating, which increases longevity and safety.
